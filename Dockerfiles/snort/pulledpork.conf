# to the snort binary.  If you don't do either of these, PulledPork will try to determine
# the version of snort by searching for the the binary on your system path.
# This is used to know which registere ruleset to download, the correct files from the LightSPD
# ruleset, and will be used to compile .so rules if you don't provide the distro.

# WARNING: RULE MODIFICATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
# The following option, state_order, allows you to more finely control the order
# that pulledpork performs the modify operations, specifically the enablesid
# disablesid and dropsid functions.  An example use case here would be to
# disable an entire category and later enable only a rule or two out of it.
# the valid values are disable, drop, and enable.

# PulledPork will use the system default temporary working directory, unless you specify a different one below.

# temp location. This is useful during troubleshooting PulledPork3 with the -k (keep temp directory) flag
